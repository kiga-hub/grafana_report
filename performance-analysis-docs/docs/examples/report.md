# Performance Analysis Report Examples

This document provides examples of generating performance analysis reports using the functionalities available in the project. The examples illustrate different formats and customization options for the reports.

## Example 1: Basic Report Generation

To generate a basic performance report, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
from performance_analysis import generate_report

# Define the input data and parameters
data = load_data("path/to/data.csv")
report_title = "Performance Analysis Report"
output_file = "report.pdf"

# Generate the report
generate_report(data, title=report_title, output_file=output_file)
```

This example demonstrates how to load data from a CSV file and generate a simple PDF report.

## Example 2: Customized Report

You can customize the report by specifying additional parameters such as the report format and sections to include:

```python
from performance_analysis import generate_report

# Define the input data and parameters
data = load_data("path/to/data.csv")
report_title = "Customized Performance Report"
output_file = "custom_report.html"

# Generate the customized report
generate_report(data, title=report_title, output_file=output_file, format='html', include_sections=['summary', 'detailed_analysis'])
```

In this example, the report is generated in HTML format, including only the summary and detailed analysis sections.

## Example 3: Generating Multiple Reports

You can also generate multiple reports in a loop for different datasets:

```python
from performance_analysis import generate_report

datasets = ["data1.csv", "data2.csv", "data3.csv"]

for dataset in datasets:
    data = load_data(f"path/to/{dataset}")
    report_title = f"Performance Report for {dataset}"
    output_file = f"{dataset}_report.pdf"
    
    generate_report(data, title=report_title, output_file=output_file)
```

This example shows how to automate the report generation process for multiple datasets, creating a separate report for each one.

## Conclusion

These examples illustrate the flexibility and ease of use of the report generation functionalities in the performance analysis project. You can adapt the provided code snippets to suit your specific reporting needs.
